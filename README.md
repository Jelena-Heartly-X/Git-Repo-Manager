## GitHub Remote Authentication

When prompted for GitHub operations:
- Enter your **GitHub username**
- Use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your password

You can generate a PAT from GitHub by visiting:  
[https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

## Notes

- Each user has their own isolated repository space inside `user_data/`
- Passwords are hashed using `sha256sum`, but not salted â€” use in trusted environments only
- No external dependencies used besides Git and Bash
